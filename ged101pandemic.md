It all started with the 2 weeks suspension...

This suspension has changed the lives of millions of people around the world changing the lifestyles of each and everyone of us with one common place to live this lifestyle which is our own homes. Our lives in the pandemic was limited in our homes which consequenty increased our online presence. 

My story started when I was excited when I heard about the suspension, I was thrilled when I heard it, this meant to me that I didn't have to go to school for a long temporary amount of time. During these two weeks I spent most of the time rotting in my bed watching youtube video after another and one game after another. After the suspension or rather near the end of the suspension it was extented that lasted for 2 years. I was also thrilled to hear this. I started playing games after games, movies after movies, and music after another music. This went on for around a year however I grew bored and I wanted to do more meaningful things besides rotting in my bed. While searching I found an interest in studying programming because it was around this time that A.I was starting to get popular and I wanted to create one for myself. This journey was short lived because I realized that it was too much work to pursue it. My next journey I found myself in studying korean, this started when I wanted to learn another language specificially japanese (I liked anime) but after searching a bit further I discovered that korean was a much easier language to learn and it was close enough to Japanese, however this was also short lived as I grew bored of it only being able to study their alphabet hangul. My next and main hobby that I was interested it was surprisingly programming again, this started whilst I was studying korean specificially when I watched a kdrama "Startup" to become famillar with their vocabulary. Up to this day I am still pursuing my hobby of programmiong thus this was the reason that I took computer science, I wanted to study the inner structure of computers.  


### Stressors and coping mechanism

During the pandemic I struggled heavily with online class because I get very anxious whenever I was in online class to the point that I didn't want to attend it just to escape the pain I got from doing it. And so what I did was escape. I started not attending online class which of course made my grades plummet to the ground. During the times that I didn't attend class I found joy in watching anime and doing hobbies previously mentioned such as programming. I escaped the world through these activities and this relived me. However I can only delay the consequences and so my grades caught up to me and I soon saw that my grades were now barely passing. 

This story has a good ending though

Following the next year aka grade 10 I was able to overcome my anxiety and was able to pass it with flying colors.

### How the pandemic changed me

This pandemic changed me for the better. I know to many this was a devestating event but to me personally I was glad it happened. I learned so much about myself during the pandemic. I learned my weaknesses, strenghts, and my potential. I was also changed as my confidence on myself has greatly incrased compared to before the pandemic this is why I didn't have any pictures of myself before the pandemic.
